<p>
  This site was built on Ruby on Rails to be a clone of
  <%= link_to 'Archive of our Own', 'http://archiveofourown.org/' %>. While
  the original site is also written in Rails, I did not copy any of their code
  when building my own (with one exception: the search page allows you to
  filter by publication date, and this requires the application to parse
  phrases like "three weeks ago" into computer-comprehensible dates. I
  copied part of the code AO3 uses to parse this, although I changed it
  significantly later on). I did, however, sometimes look at their code to get
  an idea of the general approach they used, or to see what gems they used.
